# Critical Path to Completion by June 1, 2025

Based on the project analysis conducted on May 9, 2025, this document outlines the critical tasks that must be prioritized to complete the Cryptobot project before June 1.

## Priority 1: Core Functionality (Week 1: May 10-16)

1. **Complete Order Execution Reliability**
   - Implement the `ReliableOrderExecutor` class
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern
   - Add monitoring decorators
   - This is critical as it's part of the core trading functionality

2. **Finish API Key Rotation System**
   - Implement Redis storage for key persistence
   - Add scheduled job for automatic rotation
   - Add basic permission checks
   - This is essential for security and operational stability

3. **Critical Testing**
   - Focus on testing the core trading functionality
   - Prioritize tests for order execution and API routes
   - Aim for 70% coverage of critical components (instead of 80% for all)

## Priority 2: Packaging & Distribution (Week 2: May 17-23)

1. **Configure PyInstaller**
   - Set up configuration for standalone executable
   - Implement dependency management
   - Create build scripts for Windows (prioritize one platform)

2. **Basic User Experience**
   - Create simple installer
   - Implement basic configuration wizard
   - Add first-run setup flow

3. **Documentation**
   - Create essential user documentation
   - Document API endpoints for core functionality
   - Create basic troubleshooting guide

## Priority 3: Minimal Infrastructure (Week 3: May 24-31)

1. **Simplified Deployment**
   - Create Docker Compose setup instead of full Kubernetes
   - Set up basic monitoring
   - Configure essential alerting

2. **Performance Essentials**
   - Add critical database indexes
   - Implement basic connection pooling
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data

## Tasks to Defer Past June 1

1. **Full Microservice Migration** - Continue with monolithic approach for now
2. **Service Mesh Implementation** - Use simpler networking
3. **Advanced Features** - Focus on core functionality only
4. **Mobile UI** - Prioritize desktop experience
5. **Full Test Coverage** - Focus on critical paths only

## Execution Strategy

1. **Parallel Work Streams**
   - Team 1: Core functionality (Order execution, API key rotation)
   - Team 2: Testing and packaging
   - Team 3: Documentation and user experience

2. **Daily Progress Tracking**
   - Implement daily standups
   - Track completion percentage
   - Address blockers immediately

3. **Feature Freeze by May 24**
   - No new features after this date
   - Focus only on bug fixes and stability

This plan prioritizes the essential functionality needed for a working product by June 1, while deferring less critical enhancements to later releases.
