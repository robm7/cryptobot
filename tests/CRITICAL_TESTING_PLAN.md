  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Monitoring decorators

- **Integration Tests**
  - Order execution with exchange APIs
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Circuit breaker in production scenarios
  - Reconciliation process

- **Performance Tests**
  - Throughput under load
  - Response time for critical operations
  - Circuit breaker behavior under stress

### 2. API Key Rotation System

- **Unit Tests**
  - KeyManager class
  - Key rotation logic
  - Expiration handling
  - Validation functionality

- **Integration Tests**
  - Redis persistence
  - Background tasks for automatic rotation
  - Notification system
  - Audit logging

- **Security Tests**
  - Emergency revocation
  - Grace period enforcement
  - Permission checks
  - Audit trail completeness

### 3. API Routes

- **Endpoint Tests**
  - Order execution endpoints
  - API key management endpoints
  - Authentication endpoints
  - Health check and monitoring endpoints

- **Authorization Tests**
  - Role-based access control
  - Permission enforcement
  - Token validation

- **Error Handling Tests**
  - Invalid input handling
  - Error response format
  - Rate limiting
  - Timeout handling

## Coverage Goals

- **Overall Goal**: 70% test coverage for critical components
- **Priority Components**:
  - Order execution: 80% coverage
  - API key management: 80% coverage
  - Authentication: 75% coverage
  - Exchange integration: 70% coverage

## Testing Approach

### 1. Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Test system behavior under load
- **Security Tests**: Test security controls and vulnerabilities

### 2. Test Environment

- **Local Development**: Unit and basic integration tests
- **Test Environment**: Full integration and end-to-end tests
- **Staging Environment**: Performance and security tests

### 3. Test Data

- **Mock Data**: For unit and integration tests
- **Synthetic Data**: For end-to-end and performance tests
- **Production-like Data**: For security and reliability tests

### 4. Test Automation

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated test execution on every commit
- **Nightly Builds**: Full test suite execution
- **Coverage Reports**: Generated after each test run

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Setup and Unit Tests

- Set up test infrastructure
- Implement unit tests for order execution
- Implement unit tests for API key rotation
- Achieve 50% coverage for critical components

### Week 2: Integration Tests
