# Cryptobot Project Risk Register

## Overview

This document tracks identified risks for the Cryptobot project, their potential impact, and mitigation strategies. The risk register should be reviewed weekly during project status meetings.

## Risk Scoring

**Probability:**
- 1: Very Low (0-20%)
- 2: Low (21-40%)
- 3: Medium (41-60%)
- 4: High (61-80%)
- 5: Very High (81-100%)

**Impact:**
- 1: Minimal - Negligible effect on project
- 2: Minor - Small impact on timeline or quality
- 3: Moderate - Noticeable impact on timeline, budget, or quality
- 4: Significant - Major impact on project success
- 5: Severe - Could cause project failure

**Risk Score = Probability × Impact**

Risk Level:
- Low: 1-6
- Medium: 7-14
- High: 15-25

## Risk Monitoring and Control

1. **Weekly Risk Review**
   - Review all active risks
   - Update probability, impact, and status
   - Identify new risks
   - Close risks that are no longer relevant

2. **Risk Response Triggers**
   - High risks (score 15-25): Immediate action required, assign owner and develop detailed mitigation plan
   - Medium risks (score 7-14): Develop mitigation strategy and monitor closely
   - Low risks (score 1-6): Monitor periodically

3. **Risk Closure Criteria**
   - Risk has been successfully mitigated
   - Risk is no longer relevant to the project
   - Risk has been accepted and contingency plans are in place

## Risk Response Log

| Date | Risk ID | Action Taken | Result | Updated Score | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

## New Risk Identification

Team members should report new risks using the following format:

**Risk Description:**  
**Category:** [Technical, Security, Project, Infrastructure, Quality, Other]  
**Potential Impact:**  
**Suggested Mitigation:**  

Submit new risks to the project manager for evaluation and inclusion in the risk register.
