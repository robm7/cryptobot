## 3. Initial Setup & Configuration

### Running the Configuration Wizard

When you first run CryptoBot after installation, or if a configuration is not found, you will be guided by the **Configuration Wizard**. This wizard simplifies the process of setting up CryptoBot for the first time.

Follow these steps:

1.  **Welcome Screen**: The wizard will start with a welcome message. Click "Next" to begin.
2.  **Administrator Account**:
    *   Set up your primary administrator account with a username and a strong password.
    *   It is highly recommended to enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) if prompted, for enhanced security.
3.  **Database Configuration**:
    *   Specify connection details for your database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). This may include hostname, port, username, password, and database name.
    *   The wizard may offer to set up a local SQLite database for simpler setups.
4.  **Exchange API Keys**:
    *   You'll be prompted to add API keys for the exchanges you intend to use. See [Configuring Exchange API Keys](#configuring-exchange-api-keys) for more details on obtaining these.
    *   For each exchange, you'll typically need an API Key and a Secret Key. Ensure the keys have the necessary permissions for trading and querying account information, but **not** for withdrawals.
5.  **Notification Setup (Optional)**:
    *   Configure how you want to receive alerts (e.g., email, Telegram). You'll need to provide relevant details like SMTP server information for email or a Telegram Bot token and Chat ID.
6.  **Review & Save**:
    *   Review all the configuration settings you've entered.
    *   Click "Finish" or "Save" to store the configuration. CryptoBot will then attempt to initialize with these settings.

If the wizard encounters any issues (e.g., cannot connect to the database), it will provide an error message and allow you to correct the settings.

### Post-Installation Configuration Checks

After completing the Configuration Wizard, it's a good practice to:

*   **Log in to the Dashboard**: Ensure you can access the dashboard with your new administrator credentials.
*   **Check Service Status**: Navigate to the system monitoring section (if available immediately) or check logs to ensure all core services have started correctly.
*   **Verify Exchange Connections**: In the dashboard, check the status of your configured exchange connections. They should indicate a successful connection.

## 4. Understanding the Dashboard

The CryptoBot Dashboard is your central hub for interacting with the system. It provides a comprehensive overview of your trading activities, strategies, and system health.

### Dashboard Layout Overview

The dashboard is typically organized into several main areas:

*   **Main Navigation Panel**: Usually on the left side or top, allowing you to switch between different sections.
*   **Main Content Area**: Displays the information and controls for the currently selected section.
*   **Status Bar/Header**: May show overall system status, notifications, and user account options.

### Key Sections:

#### Strategies View
*   **Purpose**: Lists all available trading strategies, both active and inactive.
*   **Information**: For each strategy, you can typically see its name, current status (e.g., running, stopped, error), key performance indicators (KPIs) if active, and associated exchange/market.
*   **Actions**: From here, you might be able to start/stop strategies, view detailed logs, or access configuration settings for a specific strategy.

#### Backtesting Hub
*   **Purpose**: This is where you can test your trading strategies against historical market data.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   Select a strategy to test.
    *   Define backtesting parameters (e.g., date range, trading pair, timeframe, initial capital).
    *   Run single backtests, perform parameter optimization, and conduct walk-forward tests.
    *   View detailed backtest reports including performance metrics, trade lists, and equity curves.

#### Trade View (Current Positions & History)
*   **Purpose**: Provides insight into your current and past trading activities.
*   **Sub-sections often include**:
    *   **Open Positions**: Shows all currently active trades, including entry price, current price, profit/loss, and associated strategy.
    *   **Trade History**: A log of all executed trades, including entry/exit points, size, fees, and profit/loss for each trade.
    *   **Order History**: A detailed list of all orders placed with exchanges (e.g., limit, market), their status (filled, cancelled, pending), and execution details.

#### System Settings
*   **Purpose**: Allows you to configure various aspects of CryptoBot.
*   **Common Settings**:
    *   User management (if multiple users are supported).
    *   API key management for exchanges.
    *   Notification preferences.
    *   Application-wide parameters (e.g., logging levels, default timezone).
    *   Database and other service connection details (may require restart).

### Navigating the Dashboard

*   Use the main navigation panel (sidebar or top menu) to switch between the key sections described above.
*   Look for action buttons (e.g., "Run Backtest," "Deploy Strategy," "Add API Key") within each section to perform tasks.
*   Pay attention to notifications or alerts displayed on the dashboard, as they can provide important information about system events or trading activities.

## 5. Managing Strategies

CryptoBot allows you to manage and deploy trading strategies. At this stage, the focus is on working with pre-configured or system-provided strategies.

### Viewing Available Strategies

1.  Navigate to the **"Strategies"** or **"Strategies View"** section of the dashboard.
2.  Here you will see a list of all strategies known to the system. This may include:
    *   Built-in strategies provided with CryptoBot.
    *   Strategies you have previously configured or imported (if applicable).
3.  The list will typically show key information such as:
    *   Strategy Name
    *   Version (if applicable)
    *   Status (e.g., Active, Inactive, Deployed on X exchange)
    *   A brief description or key parameters.

### Understanding Strategy Details

1.  From the strategies list, you can usually click on a strategy name or a "Details" button to view more information about it.
2.  The details page might include:
    *   **Full Description**: A more in-depth explanation of the strategy's logic.
    *   **Parameters**: The configurable parameters for the strategy (e.g., indicator settings like RSI period, moving average lengths; risk settings like stop-loss percentage).
    *   **Historical Performance**: If the strategy has been backtested or run live, summary performance metrics might be displayed.
    *   **Associated Assets/Markets**: Which trading pairs or exchanges the strategy is designed for or currently deployed on.

### Note: UI for Strategy Definition - Coming Soon

Currently, the CryptoBot dashboard is focused on managing and deploying existing strategies. The ability to define, create, or upload new strategy logic directly through the user interface is planned for a future release.

For users with Python development experience, strategies are typically defined in code. Please refer to the developer documentation for more information on custom strategy development if this applies to you. For most users, interaction will be through the pre-defined strategies and their configurable parameters via the dashboard.

## 6. Running Backtests

Backtesting is a crucial step to evaluate how a strategy might have performed on historical market data. CryptoBot provides robust backtesting capabilities.

### Performing a Single Backtest Run

1.  Navigate to the **"Backtesting Hub"** or **"Backtesting"** section of the dashboard.
2.  **Select Strategy**: Choose the strategy you want to test from a list of available strategies.
3.  **Configure Parameters**:
    *   **Exchange**: Select the exchange whose historical data you want to use (e.g., Binance, Kraken).
    *   **Trading Pair**: Specify the asset to test (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/BTC).
    *   **Timeframe**: Choose the chart timeframe for the backtest (e.g., 1 hour, 4 hours, 1 day).
    *   **Date Range**: Select the start and end dates for the historical data period.
    *   **Initial Capital**: Set the hypothetical starting capital for the backtest.
    *   **Strategy-Specific Parameters**: Adjust any parameters unique to the selected strategy (e.g., moving average periods, RSI thresholds).
    *   **Fees & Slippage**: Configure estimated trading fees and slippage to make the backtest more realistic.
4.  **Run Backtest**: Click the "Run Backtest" or "Start" button. The system will process the historical data against the strategy logic. This may take some time depending on the data range and complexity.

### Understanding Backtest Results

Once the backtest is complete, you will be presented with a detailed report, typically including:

*   **Summary Metrics**:
    *   Total Profit/Loss (Net PnL)
    *   Win Rate (Percentage of profitable trades)
    *   Sharpe Ratio (Risk-adjusted return)
    *   Maximum Drawdown (Largest peak-to-trough decline)
    *   Total Number of Trades
*   **Equity Curve**: A chart showing the growth of your hypothetical capital over the backtest period.
*   **Trade List**: A detailed log of every simulated trade, including entry/exit dates, prices, and individual PnL.
*   **Performance Charts**: Visualizations of drawdown, monthly/annual returns, etc.

Analyze these results carefully to understand the strategy's potential strengths, weaknesses, and risk characteristics.

### Parameter Optimization

Parameter optimization helps you find the best-performing set of parameters for a strategy over a historical period.

1.  In the Backtesting Hub, look for an **"Optimization"** tab or section.
2.  **Select Strategy**: Choose the strategy to optimize.
3.  **Define Parameters to Optimize**: Select which of the strategy's parameters you want to test different values for (e.g., `moving_average_short_period`, `rsi_oversold_level`).
4.  **Set Parameter Ranges**: For each selected parameter, define a range of values to test (e.g., `moving_average_short_period` from 5 to 20, step 1).
5.  **Choose Optimization Metric**: Select the metric you want to maximize or minimize (e.g., maximize Total Profit, maximize Sharpe Ratio).
6.  **Run Optimization**: Start the optimization process. This can be computationally intensive as it involves running multiple backtests.
7.  **View Results**: The system will present a table or visualization showing the performance for different parameter combinations, allowing you to identify the optimal set based on your chosen metric.

**Caution**: Over-optimizing on historical data (curve-fitting) can lead to poor performance on live data. Always validate optimized parameters on out-of-sample data or through [Walk-Forward Testing](#walk-forward-testing).

### Walk-Forward Testing

Walk-forward testing is a more robust method of strategy validation that helps reduce the risk of curve-fitting. It involves optimizing parameters on one period of historical data (in-sample) and then testing the strategy with those parameters on a subsequent, unseen period (out-of-sample). This process is repeated over multiple "folds."

1.  **Access Walk-Forward Testing**: In the Backtesting Hub, look for a **"Walk-Forward Analysis"** or **"Walk-Forward Testing"** option.
2.  **Select Strategy**: Choose the strategy you wish to test.
3.  **Configure Walk-Forward Parameters**:
    *   **Total Data Period**: Define the overall historical date range for the entire analysis.
    *   **In-Sample Period Length**: Specify the duration of each period used for parameter optimization (e.g., 6 months).
    *   **Out-of-Sample Period Length**: Specify the duration of each period used for testing the optimized parameters (e.g., 1 month).
    *   **Parameters to Optimize**: Select the strategy parameters you want to re-optimize in each in-sample period.
    *   **Optimization Metric**: Choose the metric for parameter optimization.
4.  **Run Walk-Forward Test**: Start the analysis. The system will:
    *   Divide the total data period into several in-sample and out-of-sample folds.
    *   For each fold:
        *   Optimize the selected strategy parameters on the in-sample data.
        *   Apply the best parameters found to the strategy and test it on the immediately following out-of-sample data.
    *   Aggregate the performance from all out-of-sample periods.
5.  **Analyze Results**: The walk-forward report will show the combined performance across all out-of-sample periods. This provides a more realistic expectation of how the strategy (with periodic re-optimization) might perform in live trading. Look for consistent performance across different out-of-sample segments.

## 7. Connecting to Exchanges

To enable live trading and fetch real-time market data, CryptoBot needs to connect to your cryptocurrency exchange accounts using API keys.

### Configuring Exchange API Keys

1.  **Obtain API Keys from Your Exchange**:
    *   Log in to your account on the cryptocurrency exchange (e.g., Binance, Kraken, Coinbase Pro).
    *   Navigate to the API management section (often found under Account Settings, Security, or API).
    *   Create a new API key.
    *   **Crucially, set the API key permissions**:
        *   **Enable**: Reading account information, viewing balances, accessing trade history.
        *   **Enable**: Trading (placing and cancelling orders).
        *   **DISABLE**: Withdrawals. **Never give API keys withdrawal permissions.**
    *   Note down the **API Key** and the **Secret Key**. The Secret Key is often shown only once upon creation, so store it securely.
    *   Some exchanges may require you to whitelist IP addresses for API access. If CryptoBot is running on a server with a static IP, consider adding it for extra security.

2.  **Add API Keys to CryptoBot**:
    *   Navigate to the **"API Keys"** or **"Exchange Connections"** section in the CryptoBot dashboard. This might also be part of the [Initial Setup & Configuration](#initial-setup-and-configuration) wizard.
    *   Click **"Add New API Key"** or a similar button.
    *   **Select Exchange**: Choose the exchange for which you are adding the key.
    *   **Enter Credentials**: Carefully input the API Key and Secret Key you obtained from the exchange.
    *   **Label (Optional)**: Give the key a descriptive name (e.g., "Binance Main Trading Key").
    *   **Save**: Click "Save" or "Add Key." CryptoBot will attempt to validate the key by making a test connection to the exchange.

### Understanding API Key Security (Rotation & Revocation)

API keys are sensitive credentials. CryptoBot may include features to enhance their security:

*   **Secure Storage**: API keys should be stored encrypted within CryptoBot.
*   **API Key Rotation**:
    *   Some advanced setups or features within CryptoBot might support or recommend periodic API key rotation. This involves generating a new API key on the exchange and replacing the old one in CryptoBot.
    *   If CryptoBot has an automated rotation feature, it will handle this process. Otherwise, you may need to do this manually as a security best practice (e.g., every 90 days).
*   **Emergency Revocation**:
    *   If you suspect an API key has been compromised, you should immediately:
        1.  Log in to your exchange account and delete or disable the compromised API key.
        2.  Remove or update the key in CryptoBot.
    *   CryptoBot itself might offer an "Emergency Revoke" option in its API key management section, which would attempt to disable the key via the exchange's API if supported, but direct action on the exchange website is the most reliable first step.

Always treat your API keys with the same level of security as your account passwords.

## 8. Monitoring the System

Effective monitoring is key to ensuring CryptoBot is running smoothly and your strategies are performing as expected.

### Using the Dashboard for Monitoring

The CryptoBot dashboard is your primary tool for real-time monitoring:

*   **Service Status**: Check a dedicated section or status indicators for the health of core CryptoBot services (e.g., trading engine, data fetcher, API connectors).
*   **Resource Usage**: Some dashboards display basic system resource usage like CPU, memory, and disk space utilized by CryptoBot.
*   **Exchange Connectivity**: Verify that connections to all configured exchanges are active and healthy.
*   **Strategy Performance**: Monitor the real-time performance of your active trading strategies, including current PnL, number of trades, and any active alerts.
*   **Logs**: Access system logs, trade logs, and error logs directly through the dashboard to diagnose issues or review activity. Look for sections like "Logs" or "System Events."

### Accessing Grafana Dashboards

For more in-depth and customizable monitoring, CryptoBot is integrated with Grafana. Grafana provides powerful visualization capabilities for time-series data.

1.  **Accessing Grafana**:
    *   Your CryptoBot administrator will provide you with the URL for the Grafana instance (e.g., `http://<your-cryptobot-server-ip>:3000`).
    *   You may need credentials (username/password) to log in to Grafana.
2.  **Navigating Grafana**:
    *   Once logged in, you'll see a list of available dashboards. CryptoBot typically comes with pre-configured dashboards.
    *   Select a CryptoBot-specific dashboard (e.g., "CryptoBot System Overview," "Strategy Performance," "Exchange Health").
3.  **Interpreting Grafana Dashboards**:
    *   **System Metrics**: CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, disk I/O for the server running CryptoBot.
    *   **Application Metrics**: Performance of CryptoBot's internal services, API call latencies, error rates, queue lengths.
    *   **Trading Metrics**: Detailed performance of individual strategies, trade execution times, slippage analysis, exchange order book depth (if instrumented).
    *   **Data Feeds**: Health and latency of market data feeds from exchanges.
4.  **Customization (Advanced)**:
    *   Grafana allows you to customize dashboards, set up alerts based on metrics, and explore data interactively. Refer to the Grafana documentation for more advanced usage.

Regularly check both the CryptoBot dashboard and Grafana (if available) to stay informed about your system's operational status and trading performance.

## 9. Advanced Configuration (Reference)

While the Configuration Wizard and dashboard settings cover most common needs, CryptoBot's behavior can be further customized through a configuration file or environment variables.

### Configuration File Overview

*   **Location**: The main configuration file is typically located at `config/config.json` or a similar path within the CryptoBot installation directory.
*   **Format**: It's usually a JSON or YAML file.
*   **Editing**: You can edit this file directly with a text editor. **Caution**: Always back up the configuration file before making changes. Incorrect changes can prevent CryptoBot from starting. Some settings may require a restart of CryptoBot to take effect.

### Key Configuration Options

The configuration file may contain settings for:

*   **Services**: Enabling/disabling specific microservices or components.
*   **Database**: Detailed database connection parameters (host, port, user, password, database name, connection pool settings).
*   **Caching (e.g., Redis)**: Connection details for caching services.
*   **Logging**: Log level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR), log file paths, rotation policies.
*   **Security**: Parameters related to authentication, API security, SSL/TLS settings.
*   **Exchanges**: Default settings for exchanges, rate limiting parameters, specific API endpoints if non-standard.
*   **Order Execution**: Default order types, slippage tolerance, retry mechanisms for failed orders.
*   **Risk Management**: Global risk parameters, default stop-loss or take-profit settings if not overridden by strategies.
*   **Notifications**: Detailed configuration for email servers (SMTP), Telegram bot tokens, or other notification channels.
*   **API Endpoints**: Configuration for CryptoBot's own API if it exposes one.

Refer to comments within the configuration file itself or separate developer documentation for details on each specific parameter.

### Using Environment Variables

Some or all of the configuration options might be overridable using environment variables. This is common in Docker deployments or for cloud environments.

*   **Naming Convention**: Environment variables often follow a pattern like `CRYPTOBOT_DATABASE_HOST`, `CRYPTOBOT_LOG_LEVEL`.
*   **Priority**: Environment variables usually take precedence over settings in the configuration file.
*   **Documentation**: Check the project's documentation or `Dockerfile` for a list of supported environment variables.

Example environment variables (illustrative):
```bash
export CRYPTOBOT_CONFIG_PATH="/etc/cryptobot/custom_config.json"
export CRYPTOBOT_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
export CRYPTOBOT_DB_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname"
export CRYPTOBOT_REDIS_HOST="myredisserver"
```

Using environment variables can be a flexible way to manage configurations, especially when deploying CryptoBot in different environments (development, staging, production).

### Logs

CryptoBot generates logs that are invaluable for troubleshooting.

*   **Accessing Logs**:
    *   Usually accessible via the **"Logs"** section in the dashboard.
    *   Log files are also stored on the server, typically in a `logs/` directory within the CryptoBot installation.
*   **Types of Logs**:
    *   **System/Main Log (`cryptobot.log`, `main.log`)**: General application events, startup/shutdown messages, high-level errors.
    *   **Service Logs (`strategy.log`, `trade_engine.log`, `data_fetcher.log`)**: Logs specific to individual components or microservices.
    *   **Trade Logs (`trades.log`)**: Detailed records of all trading decisions, order placements, and executions.
    *   **Error Logs (`errors.log`)**: A consolidated view of error messages from across the application.
*   **Using Logs**:
    *   When an issue occurs, note the timestamp and look for relevant messages in the logs around that time.
    *   Pay attention to log levels (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG). ERROR messages are usually the most critical.
    *   Search logs for keywords related to the issue (e.g., the trading pair, strategy name, error message).
