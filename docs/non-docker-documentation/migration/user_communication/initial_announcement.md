# Cryptobot Platform Upgrade: Migration Announcement

**Subject: Important: Upcoming Cryptobot Platform Upgrade**

Dear Valued Cryptobot User,

We are excited to announce an upcoming upgrade to the Cryptobot platform that will enhance performance, security, and reliability. This upgrade involves migrating our infrastructure from a Docker-based deployment to a more optimized native deployment architecture.

## What's Changing

We are transitioning the Cryptobot platform from a containerized Docker environment to a native deployment. This change is happening behind the scenes and is designed to:

- **Improve Performance**: Faster response times and more efficient resource utilization
- **Enhance Reliability**: More stable operation with improved error handling
- **Strengthen Security**: Updated security architecture and improved data protection
- **Reduce Resource Usage**: Lower CPU and memory requirements for better efficiency

## What This Means For You

The good news is that this migration will be largely transparent to you as a user. However, there are a few important points to be aware of:

- **Scheduled Maintenance Windows**: Brief maintenance periods will be scheduled during the migration (see timeline below)
- **Gradual Rollout**: The migration will happen in phases to minimize any potential disruption
- **Improved Experience**: After the migration, you should notice improved performance and reliability

## Migration Timeline

Our migration will follow this schedule:

1. **Preparation Phase**: May 15-20, 2025
   - No user impact
   - Background infrastructure preparation

2. **Initial Migration**: May 21-25, 2025
   - Brief maintenance windows (15-30 minutes) during off-peak hours
   - Specific times will be announced 48 hours in advance

3. **Core Service Migration**: May 26-June 2, 2025
   - Scheduled maintenance windows (30-60 minutes)
   - Specific times will be announced 48 hours in advance

4. **Final Migration**: June 3-7, 2025
   - Brief maintenance windows (15-30 minutes)
   - Specific times will be announced 48 hours in advance

5. **Completion**: June 8, 2025
   - Migration fully complete
   - All services operating on new infrastructure

## What You Need To Do

For most users, no action is required. However, we recommend:

1. **Stay Informed**: Watch for email updates about maintenance windows
2. **Plan Accordingly**: Avoid scheduling critical operations during announced maintenance windows
3. **Update Contact Information**: Ensure your email address is current in your account settings
4. **Report Issues**: If you notice any issues after the migration, please contact our support team
