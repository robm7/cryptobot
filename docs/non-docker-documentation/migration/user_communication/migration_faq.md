# Cryptobot Platform Upgrade: Frequently Asked Questions

This document addresses common questions about the Cryptobot platform upgrade from Docker to non-Docker deployment. If you don't find the answer to your question here, please contact our support team at support@cryptobot.example.com.

## General Questions

### What is changing with this platform upgrade?
We are transitioning the Cryptobot platform from a Docker-based deployment to a native deployment architecture. This is primarily a behind-the-scenes change that will improve performance, reliability, and security without changing the core functionality you rely on.

### Why are you making this change?
The migration to a native deployment will provide several benefits:
- Faster performance and reduced latency
- Improved stability and reliability
- Enhanced security features
- More efficient resource utilization
- Better scalability for future growth

### Will I need to update my software or change how I use Cryptobot?
No, the user interface and functionality will remain the same. You'll continue to access Cryptobot through the same web interface or API. The only difference you should notice is improved performance.

### When will the migration take place?
The migration will occur in phases from May 15 to June 8, 2025. Specific maintenance windows will be announced at least 48 hours in advance.

### How long will the migration take?
The entire migration process will take approximately 3-4 weeks. However, individual maintenance windows will typically last between 15-60 minutes.

## Impact on Users

### Will there be any downtime during the migration?
Yes, there will be brief scheduled maintenance windows during the migration. These will be scheduled during off-peak hours whenever possible and announced in advance.

### Will my trading be affected?
During scheduled maintenance windows, trading functionality may be temporarily unavailable. We recommend not scheduling critical trades during these windows. All open positions will remain intact, and stop-loss orders will continue to be monitored by our failover systems.

### Will I lose any data during the migration?
No, all user data, including account information, trading history, strategies, and backtests, will be preserved during the migration. We have comprehensive data migration and verification procedures in place.

### Will my API access be affected?
API access may be temporarily unavailable during maintenance windows. If you use our API, ensure your applications can handle temporary unavailability gracefully.

### Will my custom strategies be affected?
All custom strategies will be migrated without changes. You won't need to recreate or modify your strategies.

## Technical Details

### What is Docker, and why are you moving away from it?
Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies together. While Docker has served us well, a native deployment will provide better performance, more direct hardware access, and reduced overhead.

### Will the new platform have the same features?
Yes, all existing features will be available in the upgraded platform. In fact, the improved infrastructure will allow us to introduce new features more rapidly in the future.

### Will the upgrade affect the security of my account?
The upgrade will enhance security through updated security protocols and improved infrastructure. Your account security will not be compromised during the migration.

### Will I need to update my API integration?
No changes to API endpoints or functionality are planned as part of this migration. Your existing API integration should continue to work without modification.

### Will the performance of backtesting improve?
Yes, backtesting performance should improve significantly with the native deployment, as it allows for more efficient resource utilization and reduced overhead.

## Migration Process

### How can I prepare for the migration?
No specific preparation is required. However, we recommend:
- Ensuring your contact information is up to date
- Being aware of scheduled maintenance windows
- Avoiding scheduling critical operations during maintenance
- Downloading any essential reports you might need during maintenance

### How will I know when the migration is happening?
We will communicate the migration schedule through:
- Email notifications
- In-app announcements
- Our status page
- Our community forum

### What if I experience issues after the migration?
If you encounter any issues after the migration, please:
1. Clear your browser cache and refresh the page
2. If problems persist, contact our support team through the in-app support chat or at support@cryptobot.example.com
3. Check our status page for any known issues

### Can I opt out of the migration?
No, all users will be migrated to the new infrastructure as it represents a significant improvement to our platform. However, we are implementing the migration in phases to minimize disruption.

### What is the Early Adopter Program?
The Early Adopter Program allows selected users to access the upgraded platform before the general release. Early adopters will provide feedback to help us refine the final implementation. If you're interested, you can apply through your account settings.

## After the Migration

### How will I know the migration is complete?
We will send an email notification when the migration is fully complete. We'll also post updates on our status page and in-app notifications.

### Will there be any changes to pricing or subscription plans?
No, there will be no changes to pricing or subscription plans as a result of this migration.

### Will I need to log in again after the migration?
In most cases, you should remain logged in. However, as a security precaution, some users may be asked to log in again after the migration is complete.

### Will the user interface change?
The core user interface will remain the same. However, you may notice improved responsiveness and potentially some minor visual enhancements.

### What new features will be available after the migration?
While the initial focus is on a seamless migration, the new infrastructure will enable us to release several new features in the coming months. We'll announce these features separately after the migration is complete.
