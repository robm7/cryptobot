## Migration Overview

The migration from Docker to non-Docker deployment will be executed using a parallel operation strategy. This approach involves running both environments simultaneously during the transition period, allowing for gradual migration of services and users while maintaining system availability and data integrity.

### Key Principles

- **Zero Downtime**: The migration will be designed to avoid service interruptions
- **Data Integrity**: All user data will be preserved and synchronized between environments
- **Reversibility**: Each migration step will include rollback procedures
- **Incremental Approach**: Services will be migrated one at a time to minimize risk
- **Continuous Validation**: Extensive testing will be performed at each migration step

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1)

- Set up parallel environments (Docker and non-Docker)
- Configure shared data storage
- Implement data synchronization mechanisms
- Establish monitoring for both environments
- Create and test rollback procedures
- Prepare user communication materials

### Phase 2: Initial Service Migration (Week 2)

- Migrate non-critical services first
- Begin with stateless services that have minimal dependencies
- Validate functionality in the non-Docker environment
- Monitor performance and resource usage
- Keep Docker services running in parallel

### Phase 3: Core Service Migration (Weeks 3-4)

- Gradually migrate core services
- Implement service-specific migration procedures
- Synchronize data between environments
- Perform comprehensive testing after each service migration
- Update documentation with any configuration changes

### Phase 4: User Migration (Weeks 5-6)

- Migrate users in batches
- Start with internal users and early adopters
- Gradually increase the percentage of users on the non-Docker environment
- Collect feedback and address issues
- Monitor system performance under increasing load

### Phase 5: Finalization (Week 7)

- Complete migration of all services and users
- Perform final verification and validation
- Decommission Docker environment
- Update all documentation
- Conduct post-migration review

## Service Migration Sequence

Services will be migrated in the following order, based on dependencies and criticality:

### Group 1: Infrastructure Services (Low Risk)
1. **Data Service**
   - Rationale: Primarily read-only operations, easily reversible
   - Dependencies: Database
   - Estimated migration time: 1 day
   - Validation criteria: Historical data retrieval functions correctly

2. **Backtest Service**
   - Rationale: Non-critical for live trading, isolated functionality
   - Dependencies: Data Service
   - Estimated migration time: 1 day
   - Validation criteria: Backtest results match between environments

### Group 2: Supporting Services (Medium Risk)
3. **Strategy Service**
   - Rationale: Required for strategy management but not direct trading
   - Dependencies: Database
   - Estimated migration time: 1-2 days
   - Validation criteria: Strategy CRUD operations function correctly

4. **Auth Service**
   - Rationale: Critical for security but can be migrated with proper session handling
   - Dependencies: Database
   - Estimated migration time: 1-2 days
   - Validation criteria: Authentication and authorization work correctly

### Group 3: Critical Services (High Risk)
5. **Trade Service**
   - Rationale: Directly impacts user funds, highest risk
   - Dependencies: Auth Service, Strategy Service, Data Service
   - Estimated migration time: 2-3 days
   - Validation criteria: Trade execution matches between environments, no duplicate orders

6. **MCP Services**
   - Rationale: Advanced features that depend on core services
   - Dependencies: All other services
   - Estimated migration time: 2 days
   - Validation criteria: All MCP functionality works correctly

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Trade Execution**
   - Risk: Duplicate orders or missed trades during transition
   - Mitigation: Implement read-only mode during migration, validate all orders
   
2. **Data Synchronization**
   - Risk: Data inconsistency between environments
   - Mitigation: Regular synchronization, validation checks, transaction logs

3. **Authentication**
   - Risk: Session interruption, unauthorized access
   - Mitigation: Extended session validity, IP verification, activity monitoring

4. **Performance Degradation**
   - Risk: Non-Docker environment may have different performance characteristics
   - Mitigation: Performance testing, gradual scaling, monitoring

### Contingency Plans

1. **Service Failure**
   - Immediate rollback to Docker environment
   - Incident response team activation
   - User communication about temporary service degradation

2. **Data Inconsistency**
   - Halt migration process
   - Reconcile data using backup and transaction logs
   - Validate data integrity before resuming

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Scale resources in non-Docker environment
   - Optimize configurations
   - If unresolvable, roll back and reassess architecture

## Rollback Strategy

Each migration step will include a detailed rollback procedure. The general rollback process is:

1. **Immediate Rollback Trigger**
   - Critical service failure
   - Data corruption
   - Security breach
   - Severe performance degradation

2. **Rollback Process**
   - Redirect traffic back to Docker services
   - Verify Docker services are operational
   - Synchronize any new data back to Docker environment
   - Notify affected users

3. **Post-Rollback Analysis**
   - Investigate root cause
   - Update migration plan
   - Implement fixes
   - Reschedule migration attempt

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-Migration Testing

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Verify all features work in non-Docker environment
   - Compare results with Docker environment
   - Automate test cases for regression testing

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark both environments
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize non-Docker configuration

3. **Security Testing**
   - Verify authentication and authorization
   - Test network security
   - Validate data protection measures

### During Migration Testing

1. **Smoke Testing**
   - Quick verification after each service migration
   - Critical path testing
   - Basic functionality validation

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify service interactions
   - Test end-to-end workflows
   - Validate data flow between services

3. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time performance monitoring
   - Error rate tracking
   - User experience metrics

### Post-Migration Testing

1. **Full Regression Testing**
   - Complete test suite execution
   - Edge case validation
   - Long-running stability tests

2. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Feedback from early adopters
   - Validation of user workflows
   - Performance satisfaction survey

## Timeline

| Week | Phase | Key Activities |
|------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Preparation | Set up parallel environments, implement data synchronization |
| 2 | Initial Service Migration | Migrate Data and Backtest services |
| 3-4 | Core Service Migration | Migrate Strategy, Auth, and Trade services |
| 5-6 | User Migration | Gradually migrate users in batches |
| 7 | Finalization | Complete migration, decommission Docker |

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All services are running in the non-Docker environment
2. Performance meets or exceeds the Docker environment
3. No data loss or corruption has occurred
4. All users have been migrated successfully
5. No critical issues reported for 7 consecutive days
6. Documentation is updated to reflect the new deployment model
7. Support team is fully trained on the non-Docker environment

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to transitioning from Docker to non-Docker deployment while minimizing risk and disruption. By following this incremental approach with continuous testing and validation, we can ensure a smooth migration experience for both administrators and end users.
