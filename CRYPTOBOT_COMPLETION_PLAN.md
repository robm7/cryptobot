- **Risk**: Rushing to complete features may lead to cutting corners and accumulating technical debt.
- **Impact**: High - Could lead to stability issues and slow down future development.
- **Mitigation**: 
  * Maintain strict code review processes
  * Enforce test coverage requirements
  * Schedule regular refactoring sessions
  * Document any technical compromises made for later addressing

#### Integration Challenges
- **Risk**: Microservice migration may lead to integration issues between services.
- **Impact**: High - Could delay the entire project timeline.
- **Mitigation**:
  * Create detailed interface contracts before implementation
  * Implement comprehensive integration tests
  * Use feature flags to gradually roll out changes
  * Plan for rollback capability if issues arise

#### Performance Issues
- **Risk**: The system may not perform adequately under real-world load.
- **Impact**: Medium - Could require significant rework.
- **Mitigation**:
  * Implement performance testing early
  * Set up monitoring and alerting
  * Design with scalability in mind from the start
  * Identify performance bottlenecks proactively

#### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Risk**: Security issues may be discovered late in development.
- **Impact**: High - Could delay launch or lead to security incidents.
- **Mitigation**:
  * Conduct security reviews throughout development
  * Implement security testing in CI/CD pipeline
  * Use static analysis tools for security scanning
  * Plan for rapid security patching process

#### Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Limited developer resources may slow progress.
- **Impact**: Medium - Could extend timeline.
- **Mitigation**:
  * Prioritize tasks based on critical path
  * Consider bringing in additional resources for peak periods
  * Identify tasks that can be deferred if necessary
  * Focus on automation to increase efficiency
