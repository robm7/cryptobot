# CryptoBot Non-Docker Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural design for a non-Docker version of the CryptoBot application using a hybrid packaging approach. The design focuses on:

1. Performance optimization
2. Deployment simplicity
3. Resource efficiency
4. Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
5. Beginner-friendly user experience

The architecture uses a single executable approach with configurable components, bundled SQLite database (with external database options), and a web dashboard with a simple launcher application.

## 1. Core Package Components vs. Optional Add-ons
